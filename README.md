# Zimbra Docker

There is now 2 maintained versions of Docker.

For testing purposes we recommend the Zextras docker, multiple versions: https://hub.docker.com/r/zextras/zimbra8/

For production purpose (work in progress), Zimbra docker from Zimbra upstream: https://github.com/Zimbra/zm-docker

You can still use the docker version that was in this repo, but nobody is maintaining it: https://github.com/Zimbra-Community/zimbra-docker/commit/27bfd0ce70439140fc9a472850b98d48ca05bcfa
